    <h1>Chapter 1: We Become Stories</h1>

    <p> Expressing myself has never been easy. <br> For as long as I can remember, I have constantly tried to find a home in words. <br> It’s like trying to find my way through a maze of words that refuse to quiet, or sometimes, there are just no words at all. <br> Silence, as terrifying and scary as it might seem, carries such heaviness, bearing upon one's heart, making every breath become a struggle. <br> Like drowning, pressure keeps pulling you deeper and control vanishing like the last breath. <br> As you sink further, the cries within fade, choked in the darkness below, <br> until life and death are no longer controllable.  </p>

    <p> I remember the endless fear of chasing perfection, a pursuit I believed held promises to happiness, but only found brief moments of satisfaction and a life that felt like one failure after another. <br> My obsession with perfection comes from the plain reality of knowing, <br> deep down, <br> that I am full of flaws and imperfections. <br> I fear that no one will love me for my insecurities, like my fears expose me completely, as fragile as glass.</p>

    <p> One of the deepest ironies of being human is our tendency to regret it only when the moment has permanently escaped us, <br> realizing too late that <br> life <br> itself <br> was just a momentary speck.</p>

    <p> I think of you as inyeon, the bond that drew our lives together, even if it was only for a brief moment. <br> With you, the world felt smaller, like fate had folded it so that it was just us. <br> I fell for you little by little, though fear kept me from holding on. <br> Now you are gone, but <br> the ache still dwells inside me, <br> soft as a song I can't turn off. <br> If inyeon is real, I hope the thread will lead me back to you, <br> just like it did <br> —someday.</p>

    <p> <i> In the end, all I have are memories: moments I still ache for, my traumas, my melancholy, and the happy times I wish I could hold again. They stay with me, like pages I keep rereading. <br> Maybe that’s what it means to become stories: we live on in the hearts that remember us. <br> And I hope I’ll be remembered with love and admiration, even as I wrestle with whether I want remembrance or simply fear being forgotten, abandoned.</i> </p>

    <br> If you could see your life from start to finish, <br> would you change things?
