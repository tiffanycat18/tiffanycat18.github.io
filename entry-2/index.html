    <p> I remember having a friend, <br> persistently trailing my steps, <br> resisting my efforts to push him away, <br> providing comfort in moments of darkness, <br> and despite the tightly closed door, <br> holding a loyal presence on the red rug outside my bedroom.</p>

    <p><br> <br> I remember how my world fell apart in a flash the day I witnessed him die in a car accident, <br> his radiant, innocent, and smiling eyes, as usual, <br> gazing in my direction, about to run into my arms.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right;"></pstyle>
    <br> <br> <i> I remember how the days that followed weighed upon my soul. </i> </p>
    <p> <br> <br> <br> I carried regret like a stone in my pocket. <br> I rewound the moments again and again, wishing I could rewrite them. Wishing I had said something different. Wishing I had held him tighter.</p>
    <p> <br> </p>

    <p> Regret is like a shadow that grows longer the more I look behind me. It is a song that plays the same notes, even when I beg for silence.</p>
    <p> <br> I am a survivor of those voices. Saying that feels strange and true at once. <br> Survival did not arrive like a victory. It arrived with fear and with <br> tiny, <br> stubborn, <br> fragile hope.</p>

    <p> </p><br> <br> I do not glorify death. <br> I do not romanticize the way it can make a life feel meaningful by absence. <br> But I canâ€™t deny its strange power. I can't pretend it is only terrible. <br> So I keep the memories. <br> The bad ones and the good ones. <br> They are pages I reread again and again. <br> They are the proof that I loved, <br> and that I was loved. <br> Love and regret can live in the same small room. <br> <i> Will it bring us to another life, another version, another meeting? </i></p> 
    <p style="text-align:right;"></pstyle> <br> <br> I don't know. <br> I only know I keep the thread, <br> and I keep hoping.</p>
