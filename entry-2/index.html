    <h1>Chapter 2: When The World Became Two</h1>
   
    <p> Expressing myself has never been easy. <br> For as long as I can remember, I have constantly tried to find a home in words. <br> It’s like trying to find my way through a maze of words that refuse to quiet, or sometimes, there are just no words at all. <br> Silence, as terrifying and scary as it might seem, carries such heaviness, bearing upon one's heart, making every breath become a struggle. <br> Like drowning, pressure keeps pulling you deeper and control vanishing like the last breath. <br> As you sink further, the cries within fade, choked in the darkness below, <br> until life and death are no longer controllable.  </p>

    <p> <i> In the end, all I have are memories: moments I still ache for, my traumas, my melancholy, and the happy times I wish I could hold again. They stay with me, like pages I keep rereading. <br> Maybe that’s what it means to become stories: we live on in the hearts that remember us. <br> And I hope I’ll be remembered with love and admiration, even as I wrestle with whether I want remembrance or simply fear being forgotten, abandoned.</i> </p>

    <br> If you could see your life from start to finish, <br> would you change things?
