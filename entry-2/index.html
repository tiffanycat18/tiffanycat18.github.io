    <h1>Chapter 2: When The World Became Two</h1>

    <p> I remember having a friend, <br> persistently trailing my steps, <br> resisting my efforts to push him away, <br> providing comfort in moments of darkness, <br> and despite the tightly closed door, <br> holding a loyal presence on the red rug outside my bedroom. <br> I remember how my world fell apart in a flash the day I witnessed him die in a car accident, <br> his radiant, innocent, and smiling eyes, as usual, <br> gazing in my direction, about to run into my arms. <br> I remember how the days that followed weighed upon my soul.</p>
    <p> <i> In the end, all I have are memories: moments I still ache for, my traumas, my melancholy, and the happy times I wish I could hold again. They stay with me, like pages I keep rereading. <br> Maybe that’s what it means to become stories: we live on in the hearts that remember us. <br> And I hope I’ll be remembered with love and admiration, even as I wrestle with whether I want remembrance or simply fear being forgotten, abandoned.</i> </p>

    <br> If you could see your life from start to finish, <br> would you change things?
