    <h1>Chapter 3: A Love Letter <br></h1>

    <p> <br> </p>
    <p>I remember you, your face radiant like a puppy’s smile, bright as sunshine, yet touched with the tender sadness of the moon.</p>
    <p>When I looked into your eyes, I couldn’t hold my gaze for long. I was afraid you'd see through me, afraid my own vulnerability would bleed through. Afraid that I’d see a shining star in front of me and hope for it. I was so terrified of falling in love, even though love is the one gift I’ve always prayed God would someday give me.</p>
    <p>You were the kind of person I couldn't label. A universe in nicknames, yet no single word could quite capture the way you fit.</p>
    <p>With you, the world felt smaller, as if only two of us existed. I didn't notice others the way I usually did.</p>
    <p>And for the first time in a long time, I felt happy, unexpectedly. Quieter, steadier, like I had found something I didn’t know I was searching for.</p>
    <p>It wasn't love at first sight. I fell for you, little by little without realizing, but so quickly it felt like forever has been passed between us</p>
    <p>Sometimes I disappeared into myself, forgetting who I was outside your gravity. As much as I longed to love, my body resisted, guarding me from the pain I feared was coming.</p>
    <p>I pushed people away without meaning to. But I always hoped you’d return—or that the universe would somehow bring us back to each other, the way it did for a while.</p>
    <p>Something in me pulled so tight and tangled, and in the end, even closeness turned into distance.</p>
    <p>You're not here anymore. And that absence doesn't crash, or explode, but it dwells.</p>
    <p>It breathes through everything, like a melody that won't fade, like a story retold long after it should have ended</p>
    <p>If I could say anything now, it wouldn’t be grand.<br><br>
       Just this:<br><br>
       I miss you. Even when I shouldn’t. Even when I try not to. You were here and gone in the same breath. Real and unreachable at the same time. <br> And wherever you are, I hope something reminds you of me—gently.</p>
